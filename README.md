Santa's Naughty List is an application to help Santa track children's information and behavior. Naughty children can be added and searched. Their information can be updated and nice children can be deleted from the list. 

# How I built it
The frontend was built using Python and Tkinker. The backend was built using SQLite.

# Notes
This was my very first programming project ever. Through this project, I realized I enjoyed building and it helped convince me to pivot my career into software engineering. I will not add new features to this application. I plan to continue working on new projects.
